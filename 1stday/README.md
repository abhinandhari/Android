# First day
-We were introduced to Java, and the methods it follows
-This follows OOP, due to which everything is defined as a class
-Files end with .java
-Learned how to compile such .java files with cmd (javac)
-Did a few basic questions
-**Type casting, Switch case, Iteration , Scanner, Exceptions were taught**
-We were also taught to use *Javadocs* to our advantage.
